        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            PC Shop started as a small passion project created by technology enthusiasts who wanted
            to help people build affordable and reliable computers. What began as simple PC build
            recommendations for friends and classmates slowly grew into a local PC shop concept.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal has always been to provide honest advice, quality components, and budget-friendly
            PC solutions for students, gamers, and professionals. We believe that everyone deserves
            access to a dependable computer without overspending.
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, PC Shop continues to focus on customer trust, proper component selection, and
            continuous learning in the fast-changing technology industry.
